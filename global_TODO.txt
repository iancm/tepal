* Thoroughly comment
* Test for undefined behavior, sanitize inputs
* const it up, baby
* prototype plant, make it grow
* prototype I/O (borrow from Kilo?)
* consider use of malloc vs. calloc
* standardize return values: functions that return pointers should return
  NULL on failure; functions that return integers should return negative;
  functions that return unsigned ints should return 0 on failure.
* Document standards
* Document style
* check alignment/padding in structs
* rename calyx to tepal


Long term goals:
* Consider use of C99/C11
* Port to windows
* Port to C64
* Port to UNIVAC
* Make multithreaded
* Solve P=NP
